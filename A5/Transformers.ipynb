    "To this point we have seen RNNs, which excel at sequence to sequence task but have two major drawbacks.\n",
    "First, they can suffer from vanishing gradients for long sequences.\n",
    "Second, they can take a long time to train due to sequential dependencies between hidden states which does not take advantage of the massively parallel architecture of modern GPUs.\n",
    "The first issue is largely addressed by alternate RNN architectures (LSTMs, GRUs) but not the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers solve these problems up to a certain extent by enabling to process the input parallely during training with long sequences. Though the computation is quadratic with respect to the input sequence length, it still managable with modern GPUs.\n",

    "This assignment has 4 parts. In the class we learned about Encoder based Transformers but often we use an Encoder and a Decoder for sequence to sequence task. In this notebook, you will learn how to implement an Encoder-Decoder based Transformers in a step-by-step manner. We will implement a simpler version here, where the simplicity arise from the task that we are solving, which is a vector-to-vector task. This essentially means that the length of input and output sequence is **fixed** and we dont have to worry about variable length of sequences. This makes the implementation simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Part I (Preparation)**: We will preprocess a toy dataset that consists of input arithmetic expression and an output result of the expression\n",
    "1. **Part II (Implement Transformer blocks)**: we will look how to implement building blocks of a Transformer. It will consist of following blocks\n",
    "   1. MultiHeadAttention\n",
    "   2. FeedForward\n",
    "   3. LayerNorm\n",
    "   4. Encoder Block\n",
    "   5. Decoder Block\n",
    "1. **Part III (Data Loading)**: We will use the preprocessing functions in part I and the positional encoding module to construct the Dataloader.\n",
    "1. **Part IV (Train a model)**: In the last part we will look at how to fit the implemented Transformer model to the toy dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run all things on CPU till part 3. Part 4 requires GPU and while changing the runtime for this part, you would also have to run all the previous parts as part 4 has dependency on previous parts."

A simple example is to perform the computation `-5 + 2` using a Transformer model and getting the corect result as `-3`. As there can be multiple ways to solve this problem, we will see how we can pose this as a sequence to sequence problem and solve it using Transformers model.

There are two notions of the symbol `+` here: one is to denote the sign of the number and other is the operation of addition between two integers. To simplify the problem for the neural network, we have denoted them with different text tokens. The ouput of $(-30) - (-34)$ is $+4$. Here `BOS` and `EOS` refer to begining of sequence and end of sequence\n",
    "- Similarly, the second expression, `BOS NEGATIVE 34 add NEGATIVE 15 EOS` Output: `BOS NEGATIVE 49 EOS` means that we are doing the computation as $(-34) + (-15)$. As above, the symbol `-` here represents two things: first is the sign of an integer and second is the operation between two integers. Again, we have represented with different tokens to simplify the problem for the neural network. The output here is -49. Here `BOS` and `EOS` refer to begining of sequence and end of sequence\n",

    "We need to convert the raw input sequence into a format that can be processed with a neural network.\n",

    "The process of converting an input string into a sequence of tokens is known as **tokenization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can tokenize any particular sequence, we first need to build a **vocabulary**;\n",
    "this is an exhaustive list of all tokens that appear in our dataset, and a mapping from each token to a unique integer value.\n",
    "In our case, our vocabulary with consist of 16 elements: one entry for each digit `0` to `9`, two tokens to represent the sign of a number (`POSITIVE` and `NEGATIVE`), two tokens representing the addition and subtraction operations (`add`, and `subtract`), and finally two special tokens representing the start and end of the sequence (`BOS`, `EOS`).\n",
    "\n",
    "We typically represent the vocabulary with a pair of data structures.\n",
    "First is a list of all the string tokens (`vocab` below), such that `vocab[i] = s` means that the string `s` has been assigned the integer value `i`. This allows us to look up the string associated with any numeric index `i`.\n",
    "We also need a data structure that enables us to map in the other direction: given a string `s`, find the index `i` to which it has been assigned. This is typically represented as a hash map (`dict` object in Python) whose keys are strings and whose values are the indices assigned to those strings.\n",

    "# Part II.  Implementing Transformer building blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have looked at the data, the task is to predict the output sequence (final result), something like `NEGATIVE 42` given the input sequence (of the arthmetic expression), something like `NEGATIVE 48 subtract NEGATIVE 6`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will look at implementing various building blocks used for implementing Transformer model. This will then be used to make Transformer encoder and decoder, which will ultimately lead us to implementing the complete Transfromer model.\n",
    "Each block will be implemented as a subclass of `nn.Module`; we will use PyTorch autograd to compute gradients, so we don't need to implement backward passes manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement the following blocks, by referencing the original paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. MultHeadAttention Block\n",
    "2. FeedForward Block\n",
    "3. Layer Normalization\n",
    "4. Positional Encoding block\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then use these building blocks, combined with the input embedding layer to construct the Transformer Encoder and Decoder. We will start with MultiHeadAttention block, FeedForward Block, and Layer Normalization and look at Position encoding and input embedding later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** One thing to keep in mind while implementing these blocks is that the shape of input and output Tensor from all these blocks we will be same. It always helps by checking the shapes of inputp and output tensors."

    "Transformers are sequence to sequence networks i.e., we get a sequence (for example a sentence in English) and get output a sequence (for example a sentence in Spanish). The input sequence are first transformed into embeddings as discussed in the RNN section and these embeddings are then passed through a Positional Encoding block. The resultant Embeddings are then transformed into three vectors, *query*, *key*, and *value* using learnable weights and we then use a Transformer Encoder and Decoder to get the final output sequence. For this section, we will assume that we have the *query*, *key*, and the *value* vector and work on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above figure, you can see that the Encoder has multihead attention block is right after these blocks. There is also a masked multihead attention in the deocoder but we will see that it's easy to implement the masked attention when we have implemented the basic MultiHeadAttention block.\n",
    "To implement the basic MultiheadAttention block, we will first implement the Self Attention block and see that MultiHeadAttention can be implemented as a direct extension of the Self Attention block.\n",

    "\n",
    "Taking inspiration from information retreival paradigm, Transformers have this notion of *query*, *key*, and *value* where given a *query* we try extract information from *key*-*value* pairs. Moving along those lines, we perform this mathematically by taking the weighted sum of *values* for each *query*, where weight is computed by dot product of *query* and the *key*. More precisely, for each query we compute the dot product with all the keys and then use the scalar output of those dot products as weights to find the weighted sum of *values*. Note that before finding the weighted sum, we also apply softmax function to the weights vector. Lets start with implementing of Attention Block that takes input as *query*, *key*, and *value* vectors and returns a Tensor, that is weighted sum of the *values*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this section, you need to implement three functions, `scaled_dot_product_two_loop_single`, `scaled_dot_product_two_loop_batch`, and `scaled_dot_product_no_loop_batch` inside the transformers.py file. This might look very similar to the `dot_product_attention` in the RNN notebook but there is a subtle difference in the inputs. You should see the errors of the order less than 1e-5"

Ba et al proposed `LayerNormalization` that takes into account these problems and has become a standard in sequence-to-sequence tasks. In this section, we will implement `LayerNormalization`. Another nice quality of `LayerNormalization` is that as it depends on individual time steps or each element of the sequence, it can be parallelized and the test time runs in a similar manner hence making it better implementation wise. Again, you have to only implement the forward pass and the backward pass will be taken care by Pytorch autograd. Implement the `LayerNormalization` class in `transformers.py`, you should expect the error below 1e-5"

    "Now, we will look at the implementation of the decoder. In the  class we learned about encoder only model that can be used for tasks like sequence classification but for more complicated tasks like sequence to sequence we need a decoder network that can transform the output of the encoder to a target sequence. This kind of architecture is important in tasks like language translation where we have a sequence as input and a sequence as output. This decoder takes the input from the encoder and the previous generated value to generate the next value. During training, we use a Mask on the input so that the decoder network can't look ahead in the future and during inference we sequentially process the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving to implementing the Decoder Block, we should pay attention to the figure above. It says a \"Masked MultiHead Attention\" which actually prevents the decoder from looking ahead into the future. Lets understand with an example here. We have an expression as `BOS POSITIVE 01 add POSITIVE 00 EOS`, i.e. `1+0` that gives output as `BOS POSITIVE 01 EOS`, i.e. `+1`. Lets focus on the output sequence here. This is a sequence of length 5 (after applying our preprocessing code) and will will get transformed into *key*, *query*, and *value* matrix of dimension $5\\times128$, $5\\times128$ and $5\\times128$ respectively, where 128 is the embedding dimension of the Transformer. Now, while training, we input these vectors in the `self_attention_no_loop_batch` without mask. It will compute the dot product between *query* and *key* to generate a $5\\times5$ matrix where the first row (shape $1\\times5$) of that matrix tells us how much the word `EOS` is related with `EOS`, `POSITIVE`, `0`, `1`, and `EOS`. This means that it will use the weights of all these tokens to learn the final sequence that is to be predicted. This is okay when we are training the model but what happens when we perform inference? We start with a brand new expression, input this expression in the encoder but this time we only have the first starting token `EOS` for decoder and we don't know about the rest of the tokens in the sequence. Hence, a solution to this problem is to mask the weights inside the function `self_attention_no_loop_batch` for only the decoder part. This masking should prevent the decoder from accessing the future or next elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now look at how to generate this mask for a given sequence. Then, you should also update the `self_attention_no_loop_batch` to use the mask variable appropriately. Implement the `get_subsequent_mask`, `self_attention_no_loop_batch` with mask inside `transformers.py` file"

    "Now that we have looked at a simple positional encoding, we can see one major drawback, which is that if the sequence length gets larger, the difference between two consecutive positional encodings becomes smaller and smaller and it in turn defeats a purpose of positional awareness, as there is very small diference in two consecutive positions. Another issue is that for each position we replicated it along embedding dimension, hence introducing redundancy which might not help the network in learning anything new. There could be different tricks that can be used to make a positional encoding that could solve these problems.\n",

    "- Usually, the training regime of Transformers start with a warmup, in other words, we train the model with a lower learning rate for some iterations and then increasing the learning rate to make the network learn faster. Intuitively, this helps you to attain a stable manifold in the loss function and then we increase the learning rate to learn faster in this stable manifold. In a way we are warming up the network to be in a stable manifold and we start training with a higher learning rate after this warm-up. For overfitting we have NOT used this warm-up as for such small data, it is okay to start with a higer learning rate but you should keep this in mind while training with the complete data. We have used two functions from a5_helper.py, `train` and `val`. Here, `train` has three parameters that you should pay attention to:\n",
